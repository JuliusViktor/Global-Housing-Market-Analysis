Make sure to check your file source since this is run inside my personal computer the file path might change on your end. '

from github you can use this directory:

## Reminder:

Filtering the list again would remove the other files in the dataset so make sure to run this chunk of codes only one time so no data will be missing for the analysis below.

## House Price Index Comparison Between Year 2015 And Year 2024

This horizontal bar chart compares the House Price Index (HPI) between 2015 and 2024 for various countries. Notably, countries like China, Italy, the Netherlands, the UK, and France exhibit significantly higher HPI values in both years compared to the benchmark of 100. In 2024, these countries generally show HPI values exceeding 150, representing a 50% or more increase above the assumed 'normal' level of 100.  Additionally, a visual comparison of the red (2015) and teal (2024) bars for each country reveals the change in HPI over this 9-year period, highlighting countries with growth, decline, or relatively stable housing markets. One of many reason why some of this countries have a high number of HPI are because they have a strong economic growth and a high number of urbanization and high number of population density.

## House Price Index between 2015 - 2024 by Country

This chart above shows how House Price Index changed in various countries between 2015 to 2024, and it shows that a HPI trends vary significantly across countries, showing different levels of volatility and growth patterns. Additionaly, some countries have consistently rising HPI such as UK while others show fluctuations or decline this trends are also affected by each countries unique economic and market factors.
